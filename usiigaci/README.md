# Intended Use
A Mask R-CNN trained to detect and segment cells in 2D images.

# Images
- Microscopy modality: Phase contrast
- Data shape: 2D
- Cell type: Fibroblast (NIH/3T3) in electrotaxis
- Source: Usiigaci

# Caveats and Recommendations
This model is only compatible with the [beta release of deepImageJ](https://deepimagej.github.io/deepimagej/beta_release.html).

The model is provided as a usecase for deepImageJ. For its integration in image processing workflows it has should be fine-tuned and validated.
